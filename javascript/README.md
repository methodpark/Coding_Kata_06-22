# JavaScript Coding Kata

## Prerequisites

* **git** - you will find it
* **Node.js** - download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),
  or install via the package manager of your choice
* some editor or **IDE** (when in doubt, use
  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Get Started

* clone this git repo (you probably already did that)
* `cd javascript/`
* `npm install`
* `npm test`
* while(time) { red → green → refactor }
